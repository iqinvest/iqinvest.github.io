                <h2>diving into the blockchain wisdom</h2>
                <p>Iq invest is an experimental blockchain project for having fun
                    from exploring and investing. Iqi consists of token and a built-in exchange.</p>
                <h3>iqi token</h3>
                <p>The iqi token is a simple erc20 token with all the standard erc20 functions.
                    In addition, at the initial first stage, it can also be issued/destroyed by the owner.
                    After switching to the second decentralized stage,
                    the owner becomes a regular token holder and can no longer issue/destroy tokens.
                    The switching to the second stage is final and irreversible.</p>
                <h3>iqi exchange</h3>
                <p>Iqi has a built-in exchange with a linear function for buying/selling token for eth.
                    The exchange has 5000000 iqi for sale.
                    The token price increases from 0 to 1 eth/iqi linearly with each token purchased.<br />
                    p = 1 - (v / 5000000), where<br />
                    p - price, eth/iqi,<br />
                    v - number of tokens on the exchange, iqi.<br />
                    One exchange consumes about 58000 - 106000 gas.
                </p>
                <h2>trials and conclusions</h2>
                <h3>numbers</h3>
                <p>At the beginning of 2022, iqi has 39 holders, a trading volume of about 28 eth,
                    176 transactions and 0 hacks, vulnerabilities or other unexpected transactions.
                    Everything works as it was designed.</p>
                <h3>partners</h3>
                <p>Almost all iqi partners (11 out of 14) have already ended their existence.
                    The average lifetime of a startup is about one year.
                    Iqi is a long living project but still a startup.</p>
                <h3>mev bots</h3>
                <p>Arbitrage bot earned 0.5 eth on the difference in exchange rates
                    on the native exchange and on one of the hyperbolic exchanges.
                    There is no need to use any third-party exchange anymore.
                    All funds were withdrawn from all third-party exchanges
                    in order to increase investors' profits.</p>
                <h3>audit</h3>
                <p>Iqi has 2 unfinished and abandoned audits
                    and one copy of the compiler warnings sold as an audit.
                    Also, it has a designed easter egg that hasn't been discovered yet,
                    so welcome to hack and earn.</p>
                <h3>blogers</h3>
                <p>Blogers and other content creators earned about 5 eth in the iqi project.
                    18 out of 20 of them just attracted spammers.
                    It supposed to work somehow differently...</p>
                <h2>what's next?</h2>
                <p>Creating a smart contract is a long and expensive procedure.
                    Developers and investors will look for existing and proven contracts
                    and reuse them for their needs.</p>
                <h2>interview with Jeff, founder and developer</h2>
                <h3>How did you get involved with cryptocurrencies and their underlying technologies?</h3>
                <p>I earned my first bitcoin in 2015. I've been using bitcoin as a main currency ever since.
                    As a newbie programmer, i found blockchain development to be the best entry point.
                    I deployed my first smart contract on the ethereum network in 2017.</p>
                <h3>What were the first problems you saw when you first came on the scene?</h3>
                <p>The first problem is the irresponsible behavior of people,
                    which they have learned with the help of centralized banks.
                    For example, when someone loses a private key and then asks wallets or explorers
                    to recover it, or sends the wrong transaction and tries to revert it.</p>
                <h3>How has the existence of order books contributed
                    to the volatility of cryptocurrency prices?</h3>
                <p>There are 2 different things.
                    The classic exchange with the order book is much more complicated and expensive,
                    so it is not the best choice for the inner-blockchain exchange.
                    Cryptocurrencies are the least volatile money ever created.
                    The problem is in the paradigm of using the only one fiat currency for measure the price.
                    Fiat money is a credit money with extendable supply.
                    Every time someone takes a loan, she/he dilutes the entire money supply,
                    and your fiat money loses some of its value.</p>
                <h3>What is the Iqi project all about?</h3>
                <p>Iqi is about investment and exploring.
                    Iqi token was issued to record interactions between investors,
                    then an exchange was created to buy and sell the token for eth.</p>
                <h3>How does the Iqi project solve the problem of cryptocurrency price volatility?</h3>
                <p>By changing the price paradigm.
                    We only use btc or eth to determine the price and do not use fiat money at all.</p>
                <h3>What do you think are the causes of cryptocurrency and
                    digital assets price volatility besides the existence of an order book?</h3>
                <p>What we are seeing is the volatility of fiat money,
                    but not the volatility of crypto money.</p>
                <h3>What are your thoughts about the decentralized finance (DeFi) explosion?</h3>
                <p>People are beginning to understand the benefits of smart contracts.
                    Now we have to deal with big fees.</p>
                <h3>Does the Iqi project have any roadmap for 2021?</h3>
                <p>We plan to integrate the iqi token into our partner's investment platform
                    and start to use one more blockchain.</p>
                <h3>What do you intend to achieve with the Iqi project?</h3>
                <p>The goal is to use crypto as a main money and to develop the iqi blockchain.</p>
                <h3>What are your thoughts about regulating cryptocurrencies
                    and their underlying technologies?</h3>
                <p>Code is the law, miners/validators are the main executors.
                    That's all the regulation we need.</p>
                <h3>What advice do you have for anyone who wants to delve into cryptocurrencies and
                    their technologies?</h3>
                <p>The sooner you start, the better. Be responsible and always learn.</p>
                <h3>Please, can you tell us about your views concerning the centralization of projects
                    in the cryptocurrency space?</h3>
                <p>I did not noticed the centralization.</p>
                <h3>What are your thoughts on the high gas prices required for transaction confirmation
                    on the Ethereum blockchain?</h3>
                <p>Developers try to attract users with excessively complex solutions.
                    For blockchain projects, the simpler the solution, the better it is.
                    Most of the data should be stored off-chain.</p>
                <h3>In what ways do you think cryptocurrencies and their underlying technologies can change
                    the world?</h3>
                <p>Blockchain will remove any third parties from most deals.
                    People will trade land without any entities other than buyer and seller.
                    Many social institutions will become obsolete.</p>
                <h3>What do you think are the problems that surround cryptocurrency adoption?</h3>
                <p>People who have gained a lot of wealth in the non-crypto world will not accept crypto.</p>
                <h3>Are there other cryptocurrency projects you're involved with besides the Iqi project?</h3>
                <p>Yes, there are other projects besides iqi.</p>
                <h3>Please, can you tell us how you think cryptocurrency exchanges should operate?</h3>
                <p>Exchanges should not request or store any user data.
                    Exchange should use bitcoin as a main currency.</p>
                <h3>What would your ideal cryptocurrency market look like?</h3>
                <p>It is ideal the way it is.</p>
                <h3>Do you have any price projections for Bitcoin this year?</h3>
                <p>Bitcoin price will be the same as usual - 1 btc.
                    While the price of other currencies will correlate with their supply.</p>
                <h3>If you had three wishes and a genie that could make those wishes come true,
                    what would they be for the Iqi project?</h3>
                <p>I will ask genie to buy iqi tokens, use them and tell friends about them.</p>
